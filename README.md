## ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Scrappy/blob/master/Source/Resources/Assets/GitHubImages/signature.png)  Code Signing 

Scrappy uses free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) and a free code signing certificate
from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

The binaries and installer are built on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/is-leeroy-jenkins/networkmanager) directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Scrappy/blob/main/appveyor.yml).
Build artifacts are automatically sent to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) via webhook, where they are signed after manual approval by the maintainer.
The signed binaries are then uploaded to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Scrappy/releases) page.
